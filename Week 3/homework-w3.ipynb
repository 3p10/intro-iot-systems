This means that peer-to-peer (single-hop) links can be formed, not requiring multiple hops (this fact is presented by the network diameter). On the other hand, there might happen problems when many \"talk\" to one at the same time (the node degree is 14 ). This topology is robust against attacks against links or edges since it is clusterized (there is no special node or brigde connecting network components)."
